Machine Learning Application with AWS Cloud Services

This project implements a machine learning application utilizing AWS cloud services. It includes scripts for downloading images, preprocessing them, generating predictions using a pre-trained model, and serving the predictions via a Flask server. The project focuses on scalability, utilizing Redis for messaging and concurrency.

Scripts
1. image_downloader.py
Description: Downloads images from URLs provided in messages received via Redis.
Dependencies: requests, base64, redis
To run: Simply execute the script. Make sure Redis is running.
2. predict.py
Description: Preprocesses images and generates predictions using a pre-trained Inception V3 model from PyTorch.
Dependencies: torch, torchvision, PIL, base64, redis
To run: Execute the script. Ensure Redis is running.
3. main.py
Description: Provides a user interface for inputting image URLs and displays predictions received via Redis.
Dependencies: threading, time, json, redis
To run: Execute the script. Ensure Redis is running.
4. server.py
Description: Flask server for receiving HTTP requests to process images and returning predictions.
Dependencies: Flask, json, redis, uuid, datetime, base64
To run: Execute the script. Ensure Redis is running.
Instructions
Clone the repository.
Install the dependencies using pip: pip install -r requirements.txt.
Ensure Redis is installed and running.
